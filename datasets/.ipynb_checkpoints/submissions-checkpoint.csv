I really don't know if I loved it or hated it (maybe a mix of both?). \n\nFor starters, it took me between 50-100 pages to even realize what the heck was going on. It was like watching a really, really slow moving horror movie as things started falling into place and making sense. I kept waiting for something really big to happen though, and I don't feel like it did.\n\nI'm also not sure how I felt about Calamity as a character and narrator. I grew up in a very conservative religious household, so many aspects of the book (and her character) were actually very relatable. Ending spoiler: &gt;!Which made Calamity still holding strong to her indoctrination at the end all the more depressing.!&lt; At the same time, the way it was written with the double speak and inside language created a bit of a distance from the world and characters for me. And the rest of the characters all kind of felt like caricatures.\n\nI dunno, I'm still trying to make sense of my feelings for this book. It was definitely an interesting reading experience, but I'm not sure if I would or wouldn't recommend it.\n\nHas anyone else read it?

The reader is never told the color of a crysknife, or how the hilt is decorated. Herbert writes about his characters' experiences; usually their internal experiences.  If I recall correctly, Paul's duel with Jamis is written as a stream of consciousness/Paul's internal narration.\n\nFor contrast, the Harkonnen invasion of the Atreides stronghold is not directly experienced by any of the main characters (who are fled/captured/killed) and as such receives only the briefest of mentions.

books,vzyk2w,1657917483,Just read a new childrens book for my little cousin’s class. We really got to watch out for what the messages are being pushed!,I just read “Paws off my canon” by Dana Loesch to my little cousin’s class. It’s virtually a pro gun propaganda story written by a NRA spokesperson named Dana Loesch. Personally I’m independent on this topic but this story was so thinly written to tell kids to buy guns that it’s appalling! \n\nThe story:\n\nSo it’s about a group of animals that love to cook and we’re antagonized by a group of hyenas for food because hyenas are bad and supposedly are too lazy to cook and lack cooking skills because nobody in the story bothered to attempt to tackle that problem. Despite history proving otherwise the animals had decided to give up their coconut canons and divide the town with the hyenas in a promise that the hyenas would not steal anymore. (Sounds familiar?) Of course the hyenas quickly broke that promise and that prompted the animals to go find their discarded canons to chase away the hyenas and love their canons again.\n\nWhy we should care: \n\nFirstly:\n\n it’s the book publishing company “brave books publishing”. Like I get it free thinking and the first amendment matters- write whatever! However it comes down to the point of what are the books being published for and what is the message they’re trying to present to the world? In an age where gun control can be taught better to young kids why use this half baked approach? The kids aren’t stupid— they can handle a topic being presented from both sides. \n\nSecond: \n\nI can’t imagine most adults doing double takes to the children books they read to their kids until it’s too late—which is likely why the book  was able to be released.  That means that the parents need to really talk with their kids about what the books message is about. Parents can’t be upset at the government for mass shootings happening if they never teach the kids why it’s a bad thing to do at home. \n\nLastly: \n\nThis book was bought by the teacher who I’m sure wasn’t trying to indoctrinate the kids on purpose. However we can’t yet determine how much the story has influenced the kids which is scary because they’re the next generation. What is more unsettling is the kids the world over who are currently reading and enjoying the book blissfully unaware of the subliminal message.\n\n\nConclusion: \n\nWe adults got to be better at looking into the messages that the children books we buy for kids. Because children books stories stick with the kids for far longer than we like to acknowledge and the messages fester twice as long.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzyk2w/just_read_a_new_childrens_book_for_my_little/

books,vzn3io,1657886867,How do you deal with footnotes?,"So I’ve got pretty wicked ADD, so reading a book, particularly for an extended length of time, is fairly challenging. For me, building momentum of a sort is important to a proper reading sesh, but one thing that really trips that up is when I come to a footnote that wants me to turn to the notes section at the back of the book, where I’ll either get an interesting expansion of a particular idea, or just a citation to another text.\n\nSure, some books just pop the footnote at the bottom of the page the reference occurs on, which is a godsend (shout out to the Penguin Classic edition of *Capital*), but most of the time I’m doing the flipping back and forth, which really throws off my groove. So, any of you have a particular method of dealing with footnotes while keeping the flow going? And honestly, any other general tips for dealing with a bad attention span would be super.

Ended up staying awake until I finished, at almost 4am in the morning. \n\nI found the book highly addictive, well written and overall great. I adored it, Rocky almost made me cry (""You sleep, I watch"" is just one of those sentences that stick with you).\n\nStill, something didn't quite sit right with me yesterday. After waking up I realized what was wrong: after COVID, the level of cooperation mankind showed was just a tad too unrealistic. \n\nA global force aimed to solve a space problem which would only become life threatening in 30 tears? *C'mon*. Unlimited resources, overcoming corruption, cientists and politicians coming together? This would never happen. If astrophages happened in real life, we would just die. \n\nFor a book that takes itself so seriously, this kind of bothered me. If it was written pre COVID I could maybe get past it but as it is I just keep reading the chapters where  Stratt powers through everything to get the spaceship afloat and thinking ""yeah, right."" \n\nAside from that, it really is a wonderful read.

books,vzkfks,1657877359,Downsizing My Library. Need Opinions.,"So, first off let me say that I at one point had over 600 hardback and paperback books in my library. Over the course of multiple moves, by myself, I have gotten tired of hauling them around. I had five BIG plastic storage tubs from target and walmart full of them. During my last move in january of 21 from literally the building next door to this one, i hurt my back moving these tubs which ended up probably weighing a couple hundred pounds each fully loaded. i decided at that point that i was going to start downsizing my library.   \n\n\nOver the course of the last year and a half i have donated around 450 of them to local libraries, to my veteran hospital and apart from a couple handfuls of select hardbacks, i swapped the remaining ones to paper back. My thought process was that, in order to lighten the loads during my upcoming move next year, paperbacks would be a hell of a lot easier to move because theyre lighter. I also was thinking that going from 4 book cases to possibly one or zero would make moving a hell of a lot more simple. When I move, i'm going to try and get rid of all furniture anyways.   \n\n\nI digress.  \n\n\nHaving gone from 600+ mostly hardbacks and a handful of paperbacks to around 150 mostly paperbacks with a handful of hardbacks, im trying to figure out how to downsize more.   \n\n\nI've considered maybe getting one of those barnes and noble nooks, or amazon kindle tablets or something, but i worry that having books on a digital medium like a tablet gives the ownership power to the companies. With physical books, no one can stop me if i want to pick up a book at any time and read it, but with digital, if amazon wants to one day start charging for access, you have no control. It seems risky. Is it just a cost vs benefit analysis i need to do or what? How likely is it that whatever tablet/ebook service whether it be apple or amazon or whatever will start charging a monthly fee for access?  \n\n\nfor the record, i still use an ipod touch and itunes vs apple music for this reason.   \n\n\nDownsizing my remaining 150 ish books to nearly all digital, would allow me to get rid of two book cases, but id have to take into account the cost of the reader and the repurchase of the books i would want to re-read again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzkfks/downsizing_my_library_need_opinions/

books,vzd3e6,1657851518,A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki,"Just finished this book that I found at my neighborhood's little free library  and noticed that the last post about it on here was some years ago. I'm really looking forward to reading someone else's opinions on this one!  From the looks of the cover I would’ve never imagined the TW topics this book presents, although it was a really comforting book at the same time. This book is full of dualities, sometimes explicitly and other times discretely; which I failed to notice right until the end, and it is somehow comic considering the story is mainly told through two points of view. \n\nAt times I was confused if this was fiction or a retelling of something that happened to the author. But I guess this is the purpose of the book: to question what is reality and what is fiction, and to also consider the possibility of how these two ‘worlds’ can simultaneously exist. I also really enjoyed how this book explains something that I’ve encountered several times in books by Japanese authors: the meaning of passing away in their culture.   \n \n\nMy favorite elements from this book were  the granduncle's letters, the great-grandmother, Pesto the cat, and the possibility that certain spirits might live within words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzd3e6/a_tale_for_the_time_being_by_ruth_ozeki/

At one point she falls asleep, or hurts her ankle in a field of sorts and gets carried away by little fairytale creatures like gnomes and fairies and what not who take her into the woods.

books,w026qn,1657927544,"'The First Book of Calamity Leek' gutted me, and I need to discuss","As the title says, I just finished *The First Book of Calamity Leek* by Paula Lichtarowicz, and... wow. I really don't know if I loved it or hated it (maybe a mix of both?). \n\nFor starters, it took me between 50-100 pages to even realize what the heck was going on. It was like watching a really, really slow moving horror movie as things started falling into place and making sense. I kept waiting for something really big to happen though, and I don't feel like it did.\n\nI'm also not sure how I felt about Calamity as a character and narrator. I grew up in a very conservative religious household, so many aspects of the book (and her character) were actually very relatable. Ending spoiler: &gt;!Which made Calamity still holding strong to her indoctrination at the end all the more depressing.!&lt; At the same time, the way it was written with the double speak and inside language created a bit of a distance from the world and characters for me. And the rest of the characters all kind of felt like caricatures.\n\nI dunno, I'm still trying to make sense of my feelings for this book. It was definitely an interesting reading experience, but I'm not sure if I would or wouldn't recommend it.\n\nHas anyone else read it?

The reader is never told the color of a crysknife, or how the hilt is decorated. Herbert writes about his characters' experiences; usually their internal experiences.  If I recall correctly, Paul's duel with Jamis is written as a stream of consciousness/Paul's internal narration.\n\nFor contrast, the Harkonnen invasion of the Atreides stronghold is not directly experienced by any of the main characters (who are fled/captured/killed) and as such receives only the briefest of mentions.

books,vzyk2w,1657917483,Just read a new childrens book for my little cousin’s class. We really got to watch out for what the messages are being pushed!,I just read “Paws off my canon” by Dana Loesch to my little cousin’s class. It’s virtually a pro gun propaganda story written by a NRA spokesperson named Dana Loesch. Personally I’m independent on this topic but this story was so thinly written to tell kids to buy guns that it’s appalling! \n\nThe story:\n\nSo it’s about a group of animals that love to cook and we’re antagonized by a group of hyenas for food because hyenas are bad and supposedly are too lazy to cook and lack cooking skills because nobody in the story bothered to attempt to tackle that problem. Despite history proving otherwise the animals had decided to give up their coconut canons and divide the town with the hyenas in a promise that the hyenas would not steal anymore. (Sounds familiar?) Of course the hyenas quickly broke that promise and that prompted the animals to go find their discarded canons to chase away the hyenas and love their canons again.\n\nWhy we should care: \n\nFirstly:\n\n it’s the book publishing company “brave books publishing”. Like I get it free thinking and the first amendment matters- write whatever! However it comes down to the point of what are the books being published for and what is the message they’re trying to present to the world? In an age where gun control can be taught better to young kids why use this half baked approach? The kids aren’t stupid— they can handle a topic being presented from both sides. \n\nSecond: \n\nI can’t imagine most adults doing double takes to the children books they read to their kids until it’s too late—which is likely why the book  was able to be released.  That means that the parents need to really talk with their kids about what the books message is about. Parents can’t be upset at the government for mass shootings happening if they never teach the kids why it’s a bad thing to do at home. \n\nLastly: \n\nThis book was bought by the teacher who I’m sure wasn’t trying to indoctrinate the kids on purpose. However we can’t yet determine how much the story has influenced the kids which is scary because they’re the next generation. What is more unsettling is the kids the world over who are currently reading and enjoying the book blissfully unaware of the subliminal message.\n\n\nConclusion: \n\nWe adults got to be better at looking into the messages that the children books we buy for kids. Because children books stories stick with the kids for far longer than we like to acknowledge and the messages fester twice as long.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzyk2w/just_read_a_new_childrens_book_for_my_little/

books,vzkfks,1657877359,Downsizing My Library. Need Opinions.,"So, first off let me say that I at one point had over 600 hardback and paperback books in my library. Over the course of multiple moves, by myself, I have gotten tired of hauling them around. I had five BIG plastic storage tubs from target and walmart full of them. During my last move in january of 21 from literally the building next door to this one, i hurt my back moving these tubs which ended up probably weighing a couple hundred pounds each fully loaded. i decided at that point that i was going to start downsizing my library.   \n\n\nOver the course of the last year and a half i have donated around 450 of them to local libraries, to my veteran hospital and apart from a couple handfuls of select hardbacks, i swapped the remaining ones to paper back. My thought process was that, in order to lighten the loads during my upcoming move next year, paperbacks would be a hell of a lot easier to move because theyre lighter. I also was thinking that going from 4 book cases to possibly one or zero would make moving a hell of a lot more simple. When I move, i'm going to try and get rid of all furniture anyways.   \n\n\nI digress.  \n\n\nHaving gone from 600+ mostly hardbacks and a handful of paperbacks to around 150 mostly paperbacks with a handful of hardbacks, im trying to figure out how to downsize more.   \n\n\nI've considered maybe getting one of those barnes and noble nooks, or amazon kindle tablets or something, but i worry that having books on a digital medium like a tablet gives the ownership power to the companies. With physical books, no one can stop me if i want to pick up a book at any time and read it, but with digital, if amazon wants to one day start charging for access, you have no control. It seems risky. Is it just a cost vs benefit analysis i need to do or what? How likely is it that whatever tablet/ebook service whether it be apple or amazon or whatever will start charging a monthly fee for access?  \n\n\nfor the record, i still use an ipod touch and itunes vs apple music for this reason.   \n\n\nDownsizing my remaining 150 ish books to nearly all digital, would allow me to get rid of two book cases, but id have to take into account the cost of the reader and the repurchase of the books i would want to re-read again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzkfks/downsizing_my_library_need_opinions/

But I guess this is the purpose of the book: to question what is reality and what is fiction, and to also consider the possibility of how these two ‘worlds’ can simultaneously exist. I also really enjoyed how this book explains something that I’ve encountered several times in books by Japanese authors: the meaning of passing away in their culture.   \n \n\nMy favorite elements from this book were  the granduncle's letters, the great-grandmother, Pesto the cat, and the possibility that certain spirits might live within words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzd3e6/a_tale_for_the_time_being_by_ruth_ozeki/

I don’t think anything will top that death in Gai-jin for shock factor. \n\nThe world building is simply sublime, the characters backstories &amp; motivations deeply developed and the scale unmatched.

I really don't know if I loved it or hated it (maybe a mix of both?). \n\nFor starters, it took me between 50-100 pages to even realize what the heck was going on. It was like watching a really, really slow moving horror movie as things started falling into place and making sense. I kept waiting for something really big to happen though, and I don't feel like it did.\n\nI'm also not sure how I felt about Calamity as a character and narrator. I grew up in a very conservative religious household, so many aspects of the book (and her character) were actually very relatable. Ending spoiler: &gt;!Which made Calamity still holding strong to her indoctrination at the end all the more depressing.!&lt; At the same time, the way it was written with the double speak and inside language created a bit of a distance from the world and characters for me. And the rest of the characters all kind of felt like caricatures.\n\nI dunno, I'm still trying to make sense of my feelings for this book. It was definitely an interesting reading experience, but I'm not sure if I would or wouldn't recommend it.\n\nHas anyone else read it?

The reader is never told the color of a crysknife, or how the hilt is decorated. Herbert writes about his characters' experiences; usually their internal experiences.  If I recall correctly, Paul's duel with Jamis is written as a stream of consciousness/Paul's internal narration.\n\nFor contrast, the Harkonnen invasion of the Atreides stronghold is not directly experienced by any of the main characters (who are fled/captured/killed) and as such receives only the briefest of mentions.

books,vzyk2w,1657917483,Just read a new childrens book for my little cousin’s class. We really got to watch out for what the messages are being pushed!,I just read “Paws off my canon” by Dana Loesch to my little cousin’s class. It’s virtually a pro gun propaganda story written by a NRA spokesperson named Dana Loesch. Personally I’m independent on this topic but this story was so thinly written to tell kids to buy guns that it’s appalling! \n\nThe story:\n\nSo it’s about a group of animals that love to cook and we’re antagonized by a group of hyenas for food because hyenas are bad and supposedly are too lazy to cook and lack cooking skills because nobody in the story bothered to attempt to tackle that problem. Despite history proving otherwise the animals had decided to give up their coconut canons and divide the town with the hyenas in a promise that the hyenas would not steal anymore. (Sounds familiar?) Of course the hyenas quickly broke that promise and that prompted the animals to go find their discarded canons to chase away the hyenas and love their canons again.\n\nWhy we should care: \n\nFirstly:\n\n it’s the book publishing company “brave books publishing”. Like I get it free thinking and the first amendment matters- write whatever! However it comes down to the point of what are the books being published for and what is the message they’re trying to present to the world? In an age where gun control can be taught better to young kids why use this half baked approach? The kids aren’t stupid— they can handle a topic being presented from both sides. \n\nSecond: \n\nI can’t imagine most adults doing double takes to the children books they read to their kids until it’s too late—which is likely why the book  was able to be released.  That means that the parents need to really talk with their kids about what the books message is about. Parents can’t be upset at the government for mass shootings happening if they never teach the kids why it’s a bad thing to do at home. \n\nLastly: \n\nThis book was bought by the teacher who I’m sure wasn’t trying to indoctrinate the kids on purpose. However we can’t yet determine how much the story has influenced the kids which is scary because they’re the next generation. What is more unsettling is the kids the world over who are currently reading and enjoying the book blissfully unaware of the subliminal message.\n\n\nConclusion: \n\nWe adults got to be better at looking into the messages that the children books we buy for kids. Because children books stories stick with the kids for far longer than we like to acknowledge and the messages fester twice as long.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzyk2w/just_read_a_new_childrens_book_for_my_little/

Ended up staying awake until I finished, at almost 4am in the morning. \n\nI found the book highly addictive, well written and overall great. I adored it, Rocky almost made me cry (""You sleep, I watch"" is just one of those sentences that stick with you).\n\nStill, something didn't quite sit right with me yesterday. After waking up I realized what was wrong: after COVID, the level of cooperation mankind showed was just a tad too unrealistic. \n\nA global force aimed to solve a space problem which would only become life threatening in 30 tears? *C'mon*. Unlimited resources, overcoming corruption, cientists and politicians coming together? This would never happen. If astrophages happened in real life, we would just die. \n\nFor a book that takes itself so seriously, this kind of bothered me. If it was written pre COVID I could maybe get past it but as it is I just keep reading the chapters where  Stratt powers through everything to get the spaceship afloat and thinking ""yeah, right."" \n\nAside from that, it really is a wonderful read.

books,vzkfks,1657877359,Downsizing My Library. Need Opinions.,"So, first off let me say that I at one point had over 600 hardback and paperback books in my library. Over the course of multiple moves, by myself, I have gotten tired of hauling them around. I had five BIG plastic storage tubs from target and walmart full of them. During my last move in january of 21 from literally the building next door to this one, i hurt my back moving these tubs which ended up probably weighing a couple hundred pounds each fully loaded. i decided at that point that i was going to start downsizing my library.   \n\n\nOver the course of the last year and a half i have donated around 450 of them to local libraries, to my veteran hospital and apart from a couple handfuls of select hardbacks, i swapped the remaining ones to paper back. My thought process was that, in order to lighten the loads during my upcoming move next year, paperbacks would be a hell of a lot easier to move because theyre lighter. I also was thinking that going from 4 book cases to possibly one or zero would make moving a hell of a lot more simple. When I move, i'm going to try and get rid of all furniture anyways.   \n\n\nI digress.  \n\n\nHaving gone from 600+ mostly hardbacks and a handful of paperbacks to around 150 mostly paperbacks with a handful of hardbacks, im trying to figure out how to downsize more.   \n\n\nI've considered maybe getting one of those barnes and noble nooks, or amazon kindle tablets or something, but i worry that having books on a digital medium like a tablet gives the ownership power to the companies. With physical books, no one can stop me if i want to pick up a book at any time and read it, but with digital, if amazon wants to one day start charging for access, you have no control. It seems risky. Is it just a cost vs benefit analysis i need to do or what? How likely is it that whatever tablet/ebook service whether it be apple or amazon or whatever will start charging a monthly fee for access?  \n\n\nfor the record, i still use an ipod touch and itunes vs apple music for this reason.   \n\n\nDownsizing my remaining 150 ish books to nearly all digital, would allow me to get rid of two book cases, but id have to take into account the cost of the reader and the repurchase of the books i would want to re-read again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzkfks/downsizing_my_library_need_opinions/

I'm really looking forward to reading someone else's opinions on this one!  From the looks of the cover I would’ve never imagined the TW topics this book presents, although it was a really comforting book at the same time. This book is full of dualities, sometimes explicitly and other times discretely; which I failed to notice right until the end, and it is somehow comic considering the story is mainly told through two points of view. \n\nAt times I was confused if this was fiction or a retelling of something that happened to the author. But I guess this is the purpose of the book: to question what is reality and what is fiction, and to also consider the possibility of how these two ‘worlds’ can simultaneously exist. I also really enjoyed how this book explains something that I’ve encountered several times in books by Japanese authors: the meaning of passing away in their culture.   \n \n\nMy favorite elements from this book were  the granduncle's letters, the great-grandmother, Pesto the cat, and the possibility that certain spirits might live within words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzd3e6/a_tale_for_the_time_being_by_ruth_ozeki/

She said she thinks it was a pretty obscure book and she only remembers bits and pieces. \n\nThe story is focused on a young red haired girl and most likely takes place in old time Ireland or Scotland. The girl is collecting periwinkles on these cliffs in the beginning. She then has to trick either giants or an evil witch or something to save her father. She also has two brothers. At one point she falls asleep, or hurts her ankle in a field of sorts and gets carried away by little fairytale creatures like gnomes and fairies and what not who take her into the woods. They have a huge party and dress her up and I think they marry her to a prince. Then she falls asleep and when she wakes up everyone is gone and she basically is only left with scraps of what happened. That’s when she heads back to her home. \n\nIf anyone has any idea what this book is please let me know!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzcws9/need_help_remembering_a_book_from_childhood/

Page 3 has descriptions of the pertinent documents.  DO NOT try to fill out the employer Certification Section (bottom of page 2).\n* NOTE: You may still be asked to complete a different I-9 form that your employer has already prepared because they'll have re-filled out their parts on a blank form for you.

Deferral percentage?\n\nWhile your new employer may not need ALL of this information, having with you will be enormously helpful if they do!

Just quit conversations if you don't like them. This is the number one social skill you need if you want to have a peace of mind. Does anyone annoy you with anything, e.g. ""I told you"" talk, just say ""if you are going to annoy me like this I'll hang up/walk out"" and do as you said. At first people will think that you are just attacking them and trying to be a dick, but they will get used to this and you will have better relationships with anyone/anything.\n\nI am Turkish, so interrupting or opposing your elders is considered super disrespectful but in my teenager years, I just couldn't take my mom trying to control every aspect of my life, she even tried to pick what I was gonna study in college. But I stood against her and went on my way. When I left for college, she kept doing the same thing, called me every five hours to ask me what I was doing and if I was doing anything ""wrong"" and I started to tell her I was annoyed by those talks and if she continued trying to control me I would hang up. So I did, and she got really mad at first, would call me 3-4 times every time I hang up just to yell at me for hanging up. \n\nBut after a few years, she got used to it.  We still talk on a daily basis, but whenever she tries to step on my boundaries and try to do ""I told you"" or ""do as I said"" talk I simply tell her ""If you are going to continue this attitude I'll hang up"" and I do, and she calls me later as usual without the annoying talk.\n\nAnd I started to implement this on my professional life. And oh boy, it did me wonders. So, I am a computer engineer working for one of the biggest companies in Turkey. I usually get job offers from other companies and I usually accept to do an interview. If the interviewer asks me ""Googling"" questions (the questions where you can find the answer with a simple Google search like ""can you tell us the steps of waterfall project management"") instead of talent questions, I simply tell them that ""You can Google this, do you have any important questions to understand my talents or my thought process?"" if they keep asking similar questions, I just say ""This is not working, have a nice day"" and hang up.\n\nAnd recently I had a similar situation while applying for master's. Applied to two of the top universities in Turkey, both wanted to have interviews. While one of them was focused on my CV, my projects &amp; papers (I published two papers on international journals while I was studying in college) and what I was aiming to do in my master's thesis, the other was different. Had a group interview with 10-12 professors, and the interview was pretty boring. They started with pretty basic maths questions, but I started to get annoyed. One of them asked me ""Can you tell me the name of the shape formed by (insert equation here) in 3D space"", I told them how it would look and said ""I can share my screen and draw it if it was not clear enough"", they said ""Not needed, we are asking only for the name"" and this triggered me but I didn't just quit yet. And then they asked me ""Can you tell us a few root finding algorithms?"" and I said ""Oh there is an algorithm developed by Newton himself (insert algorithm steps here)"" and they replied ""OK we only need the names of the algorithms"" and I just said ""OK, I am not going to continue this, questions are not targeted to measure my academic strengths but my memory of names, I do not want to study in a place where memorising instead of learning is important, have a great day"" and quit the Zoom meeting without waiting for their response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf people are annoying you, tell them that they are annoying you and you will quit the conversation if they continue.

In reality, each task usually ends up taking longer and is done more poorly due to it not getting the attention it deserves. \n\nSometimes life can be crazy and we do in fact have to do multiple things at once, but if you can it tasks should be prioritized and focused on, especially when it comes to things that are important.\n\nGetting back to the title, never assume you're good at multitasking just because it feels like you are.

The link is to a fillable pdf.  I recommend typing your information in ALL CAPS for readability.\n\n* Complete Section 1 - wait to sign *with* your new employer\n* Section 2 on page 2: RE-TYPE your name.  Fill out the parts of this form you will be providing to your new employer.  Be thorough.  Either ONE from Column A, or Something in Columns B **AND** C.  Page 3 has descriptions of the pertinent documents.  DO NOT try to fill out the employer Certification Section (bottom of page 2).\n* NOTE: You may still be asked to complete a different I-9 form that your employer has already prepared because they'll have re-filled out their parts on a blank form for you.  But now (conveniently) you'll have all your information readily transferable.\n\n3) Make clear **photocopies** of: (the employer may not ask for all of these, but simply have them handy if they do).  **BRING THE ORIGINALS WITH YOU!**\n\n* Your Drivers License (front and back on one page if you're able)\n* Your Social Security Card\n* Your Birth Certificate\n* Your Military ID or DD-214 (if you're ex-military)\n* Your Work Permit (if required from your school because you're a minor)\n* A voided blank check from your checking account for Direct Deposit (ABA Routing Number and Account Number).\n\n4) Some other **HANDY information** either on paper or on your phone.\n\n* Nearest relative home address, phone number and date of birth\n* Name, address and phone number of your physician and dentist if you may be asked to fill out health insurance enrollment forms.\n* When appropriate, have considered your 401(k) options: ROTH or Traditional?  Deferral percentage?\n\nWhile your new employer may not need ALL of this information, having with you will be enormously helpful if they do!  It will also demonstrate initiative.\n\nGood LUCK!",https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/vzvuai/lpt_okay_youve_accepted_a_new_job_now_do_this/

LifeProTips,vz2445,1657821560,"LPT: For your mental health's sake; quit any conversation which annoys you, no matter who are you having that conversation with.","I see too many people trying to play ""nice"" and torture themselves in the process. Just quit conversations if you don't like them. This is the number one social skill you need if you want to have a peace of mind. Does anyone annoy you with anything, e.g. ""I told you"" talk, just say ""if you are going to annoy me like this I'll hang up/walk out"" and do as you said. At first people will think that you are just attacking them and trying to be a dick, but they will get used to this and you will have better relationships with anyone/anything.\n\nI am Turkish, so interrupting or opposing your elders is considered super disrespectful but in my teenager years, I just couldn't take my mom trying to control every aspect of my life, she even tried to pick what I was gonna study in college. But I stood against her and went on my way. When I left for college, she kept doing the same thing, called me every five hours to ask me what I was doing and if I was doing anything ""wrong"" and I started to tell her I was annoyed by those talks and if she continued trying to control me I would hang up. So I did, and she got really mad at first, would call me 3-4 times every time I hang up just to yell at me for hanging up. \n\nBut after a few years, she got used to it.  We still talk on a daily basis, but whenever she tries to step on my boundaries and try to do ""I told you"" or ""do as I said"" talk I simply tell her ""If you are going to continue this attitude I'll hang up"" and I do, and she calls me later as usual without the annoying talk.\n\nAnd I started to implement this on my professional life. And oh boy, it did me wonders. So, I am a computer engineer working for one of the biggest companies in Turkey. I usually get job offers from other companies and I usually accept to do an interview. If the interviewer asks me ""Googling"" questions (the questions where you can find the answer with a simple Google search like ""can you tell us the steps of waterfall project management"") instead of talent questions, I simply tell them that ""You can Google this, do you have any important questions to understand my talents or my thought process?"" if they keep asking similar questions, I just say ""This is not working, have a nice day"" and hang up.\n\nAnd recently I had a similar situation while applying for master's. Applied to two of the top universities in Turkey, both wanted to have interviews. While one of them was focused on my CV, my projects &amp; papers (I published two papers on international journals while I was studying in college) and what I was aiming to do in my master's thesis, the other was different. Had a group interview with 10-12 professors, and the interview was pretty boring. They started with pretty basic maths questions, but I started to get annoyed. One of them asked me ""Can you tell me the name of the shape formed by (insert equation here) in 3D space"", I told them how it would look and said ""I can share my screen and draw it if it was not clear enough"", they said ""Not needed, we are asking only for the name"" and this triggered me but I didn't just quit yet. And then they asked me ""Can you tell us a few root finding algorithms?"" and I said ""Oh there is an algorithm developed by Newton himself (insert algorithm steps here)"" and they replied ""OK we only need the names of the algorithms"" and I just said ""OK, I am not going to continue this, questions are not targeted to measure my academic strengths but my memory of names, I do not want to study in a place where memorising instead of learning is important, have a great day"" and quit the Zoom meeting without waiting for their response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf people are annoying you, tell them that they are annoying you and you will quit the conversation if they continue.

A great focus on the keeping shots interesting, cinematography is outstanding and the choice of locations and settings are all just brilliantly selected.\n\nDe Niro is unrecognisable, a testament to great direction and a sublime actor, Pam Grier steals every scene she is in and Samuel L Jackson's character and actor is just gripping.\n\n I put this movie on years since originally watching it and was immersed the entire time without my mind drifting from the movie from an instant.\n\n Tarantino's true talent is creating fantastical worlds out of the mundane, and telling that story in the most immersive way possible.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Jackie Brown and the way the movie progresses?

movies,vzzzcb,1657921373,The cast and the way they are used in The Talented Mr Ripley is Incredible,"The main 5 of this movie are Matt Damon-Jude Law-Gwyneth Paltrow-Cate Blanchett- and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All deliver great performances in interesting points of their career.\n\nThis is closely after Damon's breakout with Good Will Hunting where he is establishing himself as one of Hollywood's biggest young stars. The depth he is able to add to the character is amazing, he has to deliver a lot of emotionally charged monologues which he totally delivers on. There is a lot of panic growing with in the character throughout the movie that you can feel through the performance.\n\nI think the impact on Jude Law is the most interesting, he had already gained steam through movies like Gattaca but this was really a big test for his potential bankability, if this movie flopped it would have left him in a rough spot.\n\nIt did not though, he delivers one of the most charming performances I have ever seen, you totally relate with Tom Ripley. The scene where he confesses that the drowned girl was pregnant and when he asks Ripley if he actually went to Princeton have such an amazing Ominous tone. Then once you get to the boat scene it's like everything that has been built pays off.\n\nThis is Gwyneth Paltrow right around her prime and while I prefer her performances in Se7en and Tenebaums I do think she did great in this. My favorites scenes of her are probably right around the end where she just seems completely broken. When she finds Dickie's rings and Ripley confronts her, watching her totally break down in fear was an exceptional performance. In her final scene when she knows Ripley killed Dickie but she can't do anything about there is deep tragedy which Paltrow displays on a high level.\n\nI do not have as much to say about Blanchett who plays Merideth but I do believe she elevated the character a lot with her natural charm when I believe Meridith could have easily been a bit of a bland character without the proper actress like Blanchett.\n\nPhillip Seymour Hoffman's Frankie character is absolutely phenomenal, he only has a few scenes but he steals every one. The dynamic he has with Ripley is amazing because Frankie is the one character that truly makes Ripley uneasy. My favorite scene is his final where he is figuring out what Ripley is doing. He helps create the ominous tone and makes the scene incredibly tense.\n\nThe part I really enjoyed about this movie is after Dickies death it does kind of feel like an ensemble movie with a rotating cast of characters, it seems like no matter how big or small the role the character is cast perfectly.\n\nOne of my favorites was Italian actor Sergio Rubini who plays a detective, he really gave off the energy of what I imagine an older Adrien Brody playing the character would give off. Jake Davenport comes in as Peter Smith and I loved him in the interrogation scene speaking Italian. The delivery of his final monolgue was also incredibly haunting.\n\nThe late great Phillip Baker Hall also plays a detective toward the end of the movie and brings his usual charm to make a fun character.\n\nThis movie was incredible and it just gave me a strong urge to write about due to how masterfully it's crafted. I hoped you enjoyed reading this since it's the first time I have really gone in depth on a film like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzzcb/the_cast_and_the_way_they_are_used_in_the/

movies,vzzawc,1657919487,Medieval epics! What is your favorite Medieval movie? Here are a few thoughts of my own.,"I absolutely love medieval epics. There are few things better than watching a long medieval war movie on a rainy day. Luckily, there has been some really good medieval movies in the last few years like ""The King"", ""Outlaw King"" and ""The last Duel"". I've now gone back and watched some older classics that I missed like ""Braveheart"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I'd love some recommendations! \n\nHere are my thought on the movies I've watched and what I plan on watching soon. Spoilers will be contained within the corresponding movie but there will barely be any.\n\nMy favorite historical/war movies during the medieval era have probably been the more recent ones. One reason is likely because the of the tone. \n\n* The King (2019) - The atmosphere of this movie is breathtaking. The slow cinematic shots throughout the movie, accompanied by an amazing soundtrack really sells it. It also has a very lonely, dark and eerie feel that I very much enjoy. I also really like the raw, dirty yet realistic fight scenes throughout the movie. \n* Outlaw King (2018) - I feel like this movie went a bit under the radar, which is a shame because I love this movie. It is somewhat similar to ""The King"" in it's overall atmosphere, that being the rawness and the gorgeous cinematics. I also want to mention how the these two movies managed to portray weather as an integral part, both through plot and visuals. Whenever I picture these movies in my head I feel a sudden urge to grab a blanket and a cup of tea to protect myself from the cold winds that haunt the movies. Also, Chris Pine was phenomenal in this movie.\n* The Last Duel (2021) - I knew I would enjoy this movies as soon as I saw the trailers. It had a great cast and it the visuals looked great which is pretty much expected by Ridley Scott. The story was good, and it felt very realistic and genuine. The fight were fucking amazing and it left me almost shouting in suspense. Finally, Matt Damon fucking slapped in this movie. It might honestly be his best performance, which says a lot. \n\nI also really enjoyed the classics:\n\n* Kingdom of Heaven (2005) - It was really great. It really feels like a classic epic with everything I want from a movie like this. King Baldwin IV (the Leper) was great and his dialogues were a clear highlight.\n* Braveheart (1995) - Although there were some boring parts it was overall extremely entertaining. I was also aware of all the historical inaccuracies before jumping in, so that didn't really bother me. Also The whole ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM"" actually got to me. As ridiculous as it may seem, I actually got a very genuine appreciation of the movie. \n\nHere are some of the movies I plan on watching next:\n\n* Ironclad\n* Ironclad: Battle for Blood\n* Black Death\n* The Green Knight\n* A Knight's Tale\n\nFinally I quickly wanted to note something. I have a strong hatred for sudden psychedelic/supernatural elements in movies in general.  I was really disappointed by ""Valhalla Rising"" because of this reason. If it includes these elements I'm almost immediately turned of. This is also somewhat visible when you look at my favorite medieval movies. The only exception to supernatural elements is if it is deeply ingrained into the universe/setting and is logically explained within it. Examples being Lord of the Rings, which is my favorite movie franchise of all time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzawc/medieval_epics_what_is_your_favorite_medieval/

movies,vzw4kp,1657910969,The Hollywood fame machine is going absolutely turbo in its effort to catapult Ana de Armas to total A-List superstardom,"During the Johnny Depp  trial, I liked reading to comments under the videos on the Law&amp;Crime  Network YouTube channel, and I noticed an unusually high number of them, through the  weeks, calling for someone named Ana de Armas to replace Amber Heard in  ""Aquaman 2,"" and I saw a few even saying it should be her or Scarlett  Johansson, the top movie actress of the past decade. Then in the past few weeks, on my  Instagram Discover page, where I get a whole bunch of pop-culture posts,  based on what I like to look at, I started seeing so many posts  featuting her, and continue to see them, even though I had only ever  tapped on a couple of them. I then saw articles not just reporting but hyping up that she'll be  playing Marilyn Monroe, the most famous actress of all time, in a Netflix movie later this year. Then I saw on page 3 of yesterday's New  York Post a huge picture of her, and how she'll be on the cover of Elle  magazine next month. Then I just saw her trending on Twitter for some  red carpet event she was at. Hollywood is pushing her like crazy; I  guess she's gonna be touted as the biggest actress in the world by the  end of this year. Based on the past 90 days of traffic to her Wikipedia  aritcle, which is the best index of how many people Googling a name or  term, the publicity is working; it's interesting to see how quickly and overtly this type of promotion is done. Will she be another flash-in-the-pan blonde actress, like Gretchen Mol or Elisha Cuthbert, who were featured on magazine coverse and all over entertainment news but then quickly receded from that level?\n\n[https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-90&amp;pages=Ana\_de\_Armas](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-90&amp;pages=Ana_de_Armas)",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzw4kp/the_hollywood_fame_machine_is_going_absolutely/

Never mind the tone deaf jokes about Thor's losses. The shots combined with voiceover do extremely well. They show Thor as this love-craving guy, who could never find the right woman, however hard he tried. The second montage underline the meaning Jane Foster carried for Thor and how great a pair they were. It was honestly so good it helped me get invested in their relationship. Just incredibly cute and charming. But the Thor-Jane relationship was done remarkably well, so I got no complaints overall. Bravo Waititi.\n\nThe Green Knight's single montage at the end is EVEN BETTER. In just a few seconds, using NOTHING but PURE VISUALS David Lowery establishes the significance of Gawain giving up the green belt - by showing what CAN happen if he doesn't. It's amazing, pure poetry, kino at its finest. Zero words. And yet every point is gotten across and understood. And the best part - our protagonist is clearly SEEING that as well.\n\nMontages can be amazing!\n\nHow about you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzvz4q/montages_what_do_you_think_about_them/

movies,vzt73q,1657903394,Paranormal Activity: Next Of Kin,"I just watched the latest paranormal Activity and ngl by the end I was a little disappointed. Not because I didn’t like the movie, but in my head I was thinking, the last one we saw was finally getting us closer to an answer to all this with the ghost dimension and all that. And I was a little, once again disappointed, that this basically created a whole different story that wasn’t building off the last movie. \n\nSo, I thought about it, and it took me a few seconds after watching it. I ended up thinking, what if Asmodeus was the guy behind it all? Now that sorta got shut down because the ghost of all the movies name was Tobi. But I still stuck with it cuz I kinda liked the idea of that were the case.\n\nI ended up doing some research(cuz the movie has been out for a year) and to my surprise, apparently I might have been right. I saw multiple articles relating Asmodeus to Tobi, something about the Book of Tobit or something and how subtitles might have just spelled the name wrong and the “t” at the end of Tobit was silent which made it sound like Tobi. \n\nThis gives me a whole new perspective on the movie because, knowing that Asmodeus is the guy behind it, means we’ve almost essentially solved this puzzle of paranormal activity. Asmodeus was released into the world and is causing all this chaos from the other movies(prob for laughs) searching for Margot. \n\nIdk what they’re gonna do next or even if they’ll have a next one but we could be seeing a finally quite literally relating back to Margot and Asmodeus. Maybe the first time where we have a good ending and all this is over, or it’s a bad ending and it’s just him getting Margot now the world is fked.

I recommend typing your information in ALL CAPS for readability.\n\n* Complete Section 1 - wait to sign *with* your new employer\n* Section 2 on page 2: RE-TYPE your name.  Fill out the parts of this form you will be providing to your new employer.  Be thorough.  Either ONE from Column A, or Something in Columns B **AND** C.  Page 3 has descriptions of the pertinent documents.  DO NOT try to fill out the employer Certification Section (bottom of page 2).\n* NOTE: You may still be asked to complete a different I-9 form that your employer has already prepared because they'll have re-filled out their parts on a blank form for you.  But now (conveniently) you'll have all your information readily transferable.\n\n3) Make clear **photocopies** of: (the employer may not ask for all of these, but simply have them handy if they do).  **BRING THE ORIGINALS WITH YOU!**\n\n* Your Drivers License (front and back on one page if you're able)\n* Your Social Security Card\n* Your Birth Certificate\n* Your Military ID or DD-214 (if you're ex-military)\n* Your Work Permit (if required from your school because you're a minor)\n* A voided blank check from your checking account for Direct Deposit (ABA Routing Number and Account Number).\n\n4) Some other **HANDY information** either on paper or on your phone.\n\n* Nearest relative home address, phone number and date of birth\n* Name, address and phone number of your physician and dentist if you may be asked to fill out health insurance enrollment forms.\n* When appropriate, have considered your 401(k) options: ROTH or Traditional?  Deferral percentage?\n\nWhile your new employer may not need ALL of this information, having with you will be enormously helpful if they do!

It's a relatively new car, but it's just out of factory warranty and the repair was going to be over $1500. It's hot where I live and it's obviously the middle of summer so this not optional for me. Needless to say I was shocked but I gave them the OK to start work. \n\nJust after that I called my insurance company to ask if this could somehow be covered, and to my shock/delight they informed me this falls under mechanical failure and I'll just have to pay the deductible. This means I'll be paying $250 instead of $1500.\n\nI should have technically called my insurance company before approving the dealership to do the work, but luckily it worked anyway. It might not have worked out that way if I took it to a third party repair shop instead of the dealer though, so you should definitely call your insurance first to be safe.\n\nTLDR: Car AC dead?

LifeProTips,vz2445,1657821560,"LPT: For your mental health's sake; quit any conversation which annoys you, no matter who are you having that conversation with.","I see too many people trying to play ""nice"" and torture themselves in the process. Just quit conversations if you don't like them. This is the number one social skill you need if you want to have a peace of mind. Does anyone annoy you with anything, e.g. ""I told you"" talk, just say ""if you are going to annoy me like this I'll hang up/walk out"" and do as you said. At first people will think that you are just attacking them and trying to be a dick, but they will get used to this and you will have better relationships with anyone/anything.\n\nI am Turkish, so interrupting or opposing your elders is considered super disrespectful but in my teenager years, I just couldn't take my mom trying to control every aspect of my life, she even tried to pick what I was gonna study in college. But I stood against her and went on my way. When I left for college, she kept doing the same thing, called me every five hours to ask me what I was doing and if I was doing anything ""wrong"" and I started to tell her I was annoyed by those talks and if she continued trying to control me I would hang up. So I did, and she got really mad at first, would call me 3-4 times every time I hang up just to yell at me for hanging up. \n\nBut after a few years, she got used to it.  We still talk on a daily basis, but whenever she tries to step on my boundaries and try to do ""I told you"" or ""do as I said"" talk I simply tell her ""If you are going to continue this attitude I'll hang up"" and I do, and she calls me later as usual without the annoying talk.\n\nAnd I started to implement this on my professional life. And oh boy, it did me wonders. So, I am a computer engineer working for one of the biggest companies in Turkey. I usually get job offers from other companies and I usually accept to do an interview. If the interviewer asks me ""Googling"" questions (the questions where you can find the answer with a simple Google search like ""can you tell us the steps of waterfall project management"") instead of talent questions, I simply tell them that ""You can Google this, do you have any important questions to understand my talents or my thought process?"" if they keep asking similar questions, I just say ""This is not working, have a nice day"" and hang up.\n\nAnd recently I had a similar situation while applying for master's. Applied to two of the top universities in Turkey, both wanted to have interviews. While one of them was focused on my CV, my projects &amp; papers (I published two papers on international journals while I was studying in college) and what I was aiming to do in my master's thesis, the other was different. Had a group interview with 10-12 professors, and the interview was pretty boring. They started with pretty basic maths questions, but I started to get annoyed. One of them asked me ""Can you tell me the name of the shape formed by (insert equation here) in 3D space"", I told them how it would look and said ""I can share my screen and draw it if it was not clear enough"", they said ""Not needed, we are asking only for the name"" and this triggered me but I didn't just quit yet. And then they asked me ""Can you tell us a few root finding algorithms?"" and I said ""Oh there is an algorithm developed by Newton himself (insert algorithm steps here)"" and they replied ""OK we only need the names of the algorithms"" and I just said ""OK, I am not going to continue this, questions are not targeted to measure my academic strengths but my memory of names, I do not want to study in a place where memorising instead of learning is important, have a great day"" and quit the Zoom meeting without waiting for their response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf people are annoying you, tell them that they are annoying you and you will quit the conversation if they continue.

movies,vzzzcb,1657921373,The cast and the way they are used in The Talented Mr Ripley is Incredible,"The main 5 of this movie are Matt Damon-Jude Law-Gwyneth Paltrow-Cate Blanchett- and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All deliver great performances in interesting points of their career.\n\nThis is closely after Damon's breakout with Good Will Hunting where he is establishing himself as one of Hollywood's biggest young stars. The depth he is able to add to the character is amazing, he has to deliver a lot of emotionally charged monologues which he totally delivers on. There is a lot of panic growing with in the character throughout the movie that you can feel through the performance.\n\nI think the impact on Jude Law is the most interesting, he had already gained steam through movies like Gattaca but this was really a big test for his potential bankability, if this movie flopped it would have left him in a rough spot.\n\nIt did not though, he delivers one of the most charming performances I have ever seen, you totally relate with Tom Ripley. The scene where he confesses that the drowned girl was pregnant and when he asks Ripley if he actually went to Princeton have such an amazing Ominous tone. Then once you get to the boat scene it's like everything that has been built pays off.\n\nThis is Gwyneth Paltrow right around her prime and while I prefer her performances in Se7en and Tenebaums I do think she did great in this. My favorites scenes of her are probably right around the end where she just seems completely broken. When she finds Dickie's rings and Ripley confronts her, watching her totally break down in fear was an exceptional performance. In her final scene when she knows Ripley killed Dickie but she can't do anything about there is deep tragedy which Paltrow displays on a high level.\n\nI do not have as much to say about Blanchett who plays Merideth but I do believe she elevated the character a lot with her natural charm when I believe Meridith could have easily been a bit of a bland character without the proper actress like Blanchett.\n\nPhillip Seymour Hoffman's Frankie character is absolutely phenomenal, he only has a few scenes but he steals every one. The dynamic he has with Ripley is amazing because Frankie is the one character that truly makes Ripley uneasy. My favorite scene is his final where he is figuring out what Ripley is doing. He helps create the ominous tone and makes the scene incredibly tense.\n\nThe part I really enjoyed about this movie is after Dickies death it does kind of feel like an ensemble movie with a rotating cast of characters, it seems like no matter how big or small the role the character is cast perfectly.\n\nOne of my favorites was Italian actor Sergio Rubini who plays a detective, he really gave off the energy of what I imagine an older Adrien Brody playing the character would give off. Jake Davenport comes in as Peter Smith and I loved him in the interrogation scene speaking Italian. The delivery of his final monolgue was also incredibly haunting.\n\nThe late great Phillip Baker Hall also plays a detective toward the end of the movie and brings his usual charm to make a fun character.\n\nThis movie was incredible and it just gave me a strong urge to write about due to how masterfully it's crafted. I hoped you enjoyed reading this since it's the first time I have really gone in depth on a film like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzzcb/the_cast_and_the_way_they_are_used_in_the/

movies,vzzawc,1657919487,Medieval epics! What is your favorite Medieval movie? Here are a few thoughts of my own.,"I absolutely love medieval epics. There are few things better than watching a long medieval war movie on a rainy day. Luckily, there has been some really good medieval movies in the last few years like ""The King"", ""Outlaw King"" and ""The last Duel"". I've now gone back and watched some older classics that I missed like ""Braveheart"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I'd love some recommendations! \n\nHere are my thought on the movies I've watched and what I plan on watching soon. Spoilers will be contained within the corresponding movie but there will barely be any.\n\nMy favorite historical/war movies during the medieval era have probably been the more recent ones. One reason is likely because the of the tone. \n\n* The King (2019) - The atmosphere of this movie is breathtaking. The slow cinematic shots throughout the movie, accompanied by an amazing soundtrack really sells it. It also has a very lonely, dark and eerie feel that I very much enjoy. I also really like the raw, dirty yet realistic fight scenes throughout the movie. \n* Outlaw King (2018) - I feel like this movie went a bit under the radar, which is a shame because I love this movie. It is somewhat similar to ""The King"" in it's overall atmosphere, that being the rawness and the gorgeous cinematics. I also want to mention how the these two movies managed to portray weather as an integral part, both through plot and visuals. Whenever I picture these movies in my head I feel a sudden urge to grab a blanket and a cup of tea to protect myself from the cold winds that haunt the movies. Also, Chris Pine was phenomenal in this movie.\n* The Last Duel (2021) - I knew I would enjoy this movies as soon as I saw the trailers. It had a great cast and it the visuals looked great which is pretty much expected by Ridley Scott. The story was good, and it felt very realistic and genuine. The fight were fucking amazing and it left me almost shouting in suspense. Finally, Matt Damon fucking slapped in this movie. It might honestly be his best performance, which says a lot. \n\nI also really enjoyed the classics:\n\n* Kingdom of Heaven (2005) - It was really great. It really feels like a classic epic with everything I want from a movie like this. King Baldwin IV (the Leper) was great and his dialogues were a clear highlight.\n* Braveheart (1995) - Although there were some boring parts it was overall extremely entertaining. I was also aware of all the historical inaccuracies before jumping in, so that didn't really bother me. Also The whole ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM"" actually got to me. As ridiculous as it may seem, I actually got a very genuine appreciation of the movie. \n\nHere are some of the movies I plan on watching next:\n\n* Ironclad\n* Ironclad: Battle for Blood\n* Black Death\n* The Green Knight\n* A Knight's Tale\n\nFinally I quickly wanted to note something. I have a strong hatred for sudden psychedelic/supernatural elements in movies in general.  I was really disappointed by ""Valhalla Rising"" because of this reason. If it includes these elements I'm almost immediately turned of. This is also somewhat visible when you look at my favorite medieval movies. The only exception to supernatural elements is if it is deeply ingrained into the universe/setting and is logically explained within it. Examples being Lord of the Rings, which is my favorite movie franchise of all time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzawc/medieval_epics_what_is_your_favorite_medieval/

movies,vzw4kp,1657910969,The Hollywood fame machine is going absolutely turbo in its effort to catapult Ana de Armas to total A-List superstardom,"During the Johnny Depp  trial, I liked reading to comments under the videos on the Law&amp;Crime  Network YouTube channel, and I noticed an unusually high number of them, through the  weeks, calling for someone named Ana de Armas to replace Amber Heard in  ""Aquaman 2,"" and I saw a few even saying it should be her or Scarlett  Johansson, the top movie actress of the past decade. Then in the past few weeks, on my  Instagram Discover page, where I get a whole bunch of pop-culture posts,  based on what I like to look at, I started seeing so many posts  featuting her, and continue to see them, even though I had only ever  tapped on a couple of them. I then saw articles not just reporting but hyping up that she'll be  playing Marilyn Monroe, the most famous actress of all time, in a Netflix movie later this year. Then I saw on page 3 of yesterday's New  York Post a huge picture of her, and how she'll be on the cover of Elle  magazine next month. Then I just saw her trending on Twitter for some  red carpet event she was at. Hollywood is pushing her like crazy; I  guess she's gonna be touted as the biggest actress in the world by the  end of this year. Based on the past 90 days of traffic to her Wikipedia  aritcle, which is the best index of how many people Googling a name or  term, the publicity is working; it's interesting to see how quickly and overtly this type of promotion is done. Will she be another flash-in-the-pan blonde actress, like Gretchen Mol or Elisha Cuthbert, who were featured on magazine coverse and all over entertainment news but then quickly receded from that level?\n\n[https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-90&amp;pages=Ana\_de\_Armas](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-90&amp;pages=Ana_de_Armas)",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzw4kp/the_hollywood_fame_machine_is_going_absolutely/

Never mind the tone deaf jokes about Thor's losses. The shots combined with voiceover do extremely well. They show Thor as this love-craving guy, who could never find the right woman, however hard he tried. The second montage underline the meaning Jane Foster carried for Thor and how great a pair they were. It was honestly so good it helped me get invested in their relationship. Just incredibly cute and charming. But the Thor-Jane relationship was done remarkably well, so I got no complaints overall. Bravo Waititi.\n\nThe Green Knight's single montage at the end is EVEN BETTER. In just a few seconds, using NOTHING but PURE VISUALS David Lowery establishes the significance of Gawain giving up the green belt - by showing what CAN happen if he doesn't. It's amazing, pure poetry, kino at its finest. Zero words. And yet every point is gotten across and understood. And the best part - our protagonist is clearly SEEING that as well.\n\nMontages can be amazing!\n\nHow about you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzvz4q/montages_what_do_you_think_about_them/

movies,vzt73q,1657903394,Paranormal Activity: Next Of Kin,"I just watched the latest paranormal Activity and ngl by the end I was a little disappointed. Not because I didn’t like the movie, but in my head I was thinking, the last one we saw was finally getting us closer to an answer to all this with the ghost dimension and all that. And I was a little, once again disappointed, that this basically created a whole different story that wasn’t building off the last movie. \n\nSo, I thought about it, and it took me a few seconds after watching it. I ended up thinking, what if Asmodeus was the guy behind it all? Now that sorta got shut down because the ghost of all the movies name was Tobi. But I still stuck with it cuz I kinda liked the idea of that were the case.\n\nI ended up doing some research(cuz the movie has been out for a year) and to my surprise, apparently I might have been right. I saw multiple articles relating Asmodeus to Tobi, something about the Book of Tobit or something and how subtitles might have just spelled the name wrong and the “t” at the end of Tobit was silent which made it sound like Tobi. \n\nThis gives me a whole new perspective on the movie because, knowing that Asmodeus is the guy behind it, means we’ve almost essentially solved this puzzle of paranormal activity. Asmodeus was released into the world and is causing all this chaos from the other movies(prob for laughs) searching for Margot. \n\nIdk what they’re gonna do next or even if they’ll have a next one but we could be seeing a finally quite literally relating back to Margot and Asmodeus. Maybe the first time where we have a good ending and all this is over, or it’s a bad ending and it’s just him getting Margot now the world is fked.

Just quit conversations if you don't like them. This is the number one social skill you need if you want to have a peace of mind. Does anyone annoy you with anything, e.g. ""I told you"" talk, just say ""if you are going to annoy me like this I'll hang up/walk out"" and do as you said. At first people will think that you are just attacking them and trying to be a dick, but they will get used to this and you will have better relationships with anyone/anything.\n\nI am Turkish, so interrupting or opposing your elders is considered super disrespectful but in my teenager years, I just couldn't take my mom trying to control every aspect of my life, she even tried to pick what I was gonna study in college. But I stood against her and went on my way. When I left for college, she kept doing the same thing, called me every five hours to ask me what I was doing and if I was doing anything ""wrong"" and I started to tell her I was annoyed by those talks and if she continued trying to control me I would hang up. So I did, and she got really mad at first, would call me 3-4 times every time I hang up just to yell at me for hanging up. \n\nBut after a few years, she got used to it.  We still talk on a daily basis, but whenever she tries to step on my boundaries and try to do ""I told you"" or ""do as I said"" talk I simply tell her ""If you are going to continue this attitude I'll hang up"" and I do, and she calls me later as usual without the annoying talk.\n\nAnd I started to implement this on my professional life. And oh boy, it did me wonders. So, I am a computer engineer working for one of the biggest companies in Turkey. I usually get job offers from other companies and I usually accept to do an interview. If the interviewer asks me ""Googling"" questions (the questions where you can find the answer with a simple Google search like ""can you tell us the steps of waterfall project management"") instead of talent questions, I simply tell them that ""You can Google this, do you have any important questions to understand my talents or my thought process?"" if they keep asking similar questions, I just say ""This is not working, have a nice day"" and hang up.\n\nAnd recently I had a similar situation while applying for master's. Applied to two of the top universities in Turkey, both wanted to have interviews. While one of them was focused on my CV, my projects &amp; papers (I published two papers on international journals while I was studying in college) and what I was aiming to do in my master's thesis, the other was different. Had a group interview with 10-12 professors, and the interview was pretty boring. They started with pretty basic maths questions, but I started to get annoyed. One of them asked me ""Can you tell me the name of the shape formed by (insert equation here) in 3D space"", I told them how it would look and said ""I can share my screen and draw it if it was not clear enough"", they said ""Not needed, we are asking only for the name"" and this triggered me but I didn't just quit yet. And then they asked me ""Can you tell us a few root finding algorithms?"" and I said ""Oh there is an algorithm developed by Newton himself (insert algorithm steps here)"" and they replied ""OK we only need the names of the algorithms"" and I just said ""OK, I am not going to continue this, questions are not targeted to measure my academic strengths but my memory of names, I do not want to study in a place where memorising instead of learning is important, have a great day"" and quit the Zoom meeting without waiting for their response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf people are annoying you, tell them that they are annoying you and you will quit the conversation if they continue.

movies,vzzzcb,1657921373,The cast and the way they are used in The Talented Mr Ripley is Incredible,"The main 5 of this movie are Matt Damon-Jude Law-Gwyneth Paltrow-Cate Blanchett- and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All deliver great performances in interesting points of their career.\n\nThis is closely after Damon's breakout with Good Will Hunting where he is establishing himself as one of Hollywood's biggest young stars. The depth he is able to add to the character is amazing, he has to deliver a lot of emotionally charged monologues which he totally delivers on. There is a lot of panic growing with in the character throughout the movie that you can feel through the performance.\n\nI think the impact on Jude Law is the most interesting, he had already gained steam through movies like Gattaca but this was really a big test for his potential bankability, if this movie flopped it would have left him in a rough spot.\n\nIt did not though, he delivers one of the most charming performances I have ever seen, you totally relate with Tom Ripley. The scene where he confesses that the drowned girl was pregnant and when he asks Ripley if he actually went to Princeton have such an amazing Ominous tone. Then once you get to the boat scene it's like everything that has been built pays off.\n\nThis is Gwyneth Paltrow right around her prime and while I prefer her performances in Se7en and Tenebaums I do think she did great in this. My favorites scenes of her are probably right around the end where she just seems completely broken. When she finds Dickie's rings and Ripley confronts her, watching her totally break down in fear was an exceptional performance. In her final scene when she knows Ripley killed Dickie but she can't do anything about there is deep tragedy which Paltrow displays on a high level.\n\nI do not have as much to say about Blanchett who plays Merideth but I do believe she elevated the character a lot with her natural charm when I believe Meridith could have easily been a bit of a bland character without the proper actress like Blanchett.\n\nPhillip Seymour Hoffman's Frankie character is absolutely phenomenal, he only has a few scenes but he steals every one. The dynamic he has with Ripley is amazing because Frankie is the one character that truly makes Ripley uneasy. My favorite scene is his final where he is figuring out what Ripley is doing. He helps create the ominous tone and makes the scene incredibly tense.\n\nThe part I really enjoyed about this movie is after Dickies death it does kind of feel like an ensemble movie with a rotating cast of characters, it seems like no matter how big or small the role the character is cast perfectly.\n\nOne of my favorites was Italian actor Sergio Rubini who plays a detective, he really gave off the energy of what I imagine an older Adrien Brody playing the character would give off. Jake Davenport comes in as Peter Smith and I loved him in the interrogation scene speaking Italian. The delivery of his final monolgue was also incredibly haunting.\n\nThe late great Phillip Baker Hall also plays a detective toward the end of the movie and brings his usual charm to make a fun character.\n\nThis movie was incredible and it just gave me a strong urge to write about due to how masterfully it's crafted. I hoped you enjoyed reading this since it's the first time I have really gone in depth on a film like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzzcb/the_cast_and_the_way_they_are_used_in_the/

movies,vzzawc,1657919487,Medieval epics! What is your favorite Medieval movie? Here are a few thoughts of my own.,"I absolutely love medieval epics. There are few things better than watching a long medieval war movie on a rainy day. Luckily, there has been some really good medieval movies in the last few years like ""The King"", ""Outlaw King"" and ""The last Duel"". I've now gone back and watched some older classics that I missed like ""Braveheart"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I'd love some recommendations! \n\nHere are my thought on the movies I've watched and what I plan on watching soon. Spoilers will be contained within the corresponding movie but there will barely be any.\n\nMy favorite historical/war movies during the medieval era have probably been the more recent ones. One reason is likely because the of the tone. \n\n* The King (2019) - The atmosphere of this movie is breathtaking. The slow cinematic shots throughout the movie, accompanied by an amazing soundtrack really sells it. It also has a very lonely, dark and eerie feel that I very much enjoy. I also really like the raw, dirty yet realistic fight scenes throughout the movie. \n* Outlaw King (2018) - I feel like this movie went a bit under the radar, which is a shame because I love this movie. It is somewhat similar to ""The King"" in it's overall atmosphere, that being the rawness and the gorgeous cinematics. I also want to mention how the these two movies managed to portray weather as an integral part, both through plot and visuals. Whenever I picture these movies in my head I feel a sudden urge to grab a blanket and a cup of tea to protect myself from the cold winds that haunt the movies. Also, Chris Pine was phenomenal in this movie.\n* The Last Duel (2021) - I knew I would enjoy this movies as soon as I saw the trailers. It had a great cast and it the visuals looked great which is pretty much expected by Ridley Scott. The story was good, and it felt very realistic and genuine. The fight were fucking amazing and it left me almost shouting in suspense. Finally, Matt Damon fucking slapped in this movie. It might honestly be his best performance, which says a lot. \n\nI also really enjoyed the classics:\n\n* Kingdom of Heaven (2005) - It was really great. It really feels like a classic epic with everything I want from a movie like this. King Baldwin IV (the Leper) was great and his dialogues were a clear highlight.\n* Braveheart (1995) - Although there were some boring parts it was overall extremely entertaining. I was also aware of all the historical inaccuracies before jumping in, so that didn't really bother me. Also The whole ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM"" actually got to me. As ridiculous as it may seem, I actually got a very genuine appreciation of the movie. \n\nHere are some of the movies I plan on watching next:\n\n* Ironclad\n* Ironclad: Battle for Blood\n* Black Death\n* The Green Knight\n* A Knight's Tale\n\nFinally I quickly wanted to note something. I have a strong hatred for sudden psychedelic/supernatural elements in movies in general.  I was really disappointed by ""Valhalla Rising"" because of this reason. If it includes these elements I'm almost immediately turned of. This is also somewhat visible when you look at my favorite medieval movies. The only exception to supernatural elements is if it is deeply ingrained into the universe/setting and is logically explained within it. Examples being Lord of the Rings, which is my favorite movie franchise of all time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzawc/medieval_epics_what_is_your_favorite_medieval/

movies,vzw4kp,1657910969,The Hollywood fame machine is going absolutely turbo in its effort to catapult Ana de Armas to total A-List superstardom,"During the Johnny Depp  trial, I liked reading to comments under the videos on the Law&amp;Crime  Network YouTube channel, and I noticed an unusually high number of them, through the  weeks, calling for someone named Ana de Armas to replace Amber Heard in  ""Aquaman 2,"" and I saw a few even saying it should be her or Scarlett  Johansson, the top movie actress of the past decade. Then in the past few weeks, on my  Instagram Discover page, where I get a whole bunch of pop-culture posts,  based on what I like to look at, I started seeing so many posts  featuting her, and continue to see them, even though I had only ever  tapped on a couple of them. I then saw articles not just reporting but hyping up that she'll be  playing Marilyn Monroe, the most famous actress of all time, in a Netflix movie later this year. Then I saw on page 3 of yesterday's New  York Post a huge picture of her, and how she'll be on the cover of Elle  magazine next month. Then I just saw her trending on Twitter for some  red carpet event she was at. Hollywood is pushing her like crazy; I  guess she's gonna be touted as the biggest actress in the world by the  end of this year. Based on the past 90 days of traffic to her Wikipedia  aritcle, which is the best index of how many people Googling a name or  term, the publicity is working; it's interesting to see how quickly and overtly this type of promotion is done.

Never mind the tone deaf jokes about Thor's losses. The shots combined with voiceover do extremely well. They show Thor as this love-craving guy, who could never find the right woman, however hard he tried. The second montage underline the meaning Jane Foster carried for Thor and how great a pair they were. It was honestly so good it helped me get invested in their relationship. Just incredibly cute and charming. But the Thor-Jane relationship was done remarkably well, so I got no complaints overall. Bravo Waititi.\n\nThe Green Knight's single montage at the end is EVEN BETTER. In just a few seconds, using NOTHING but PURE VISUALS David Lowery establishes the significance of Gawain giving up the green belt - by showing what CAN happen if he doesn't. It's amazing, pure poetry, kino at its finest. Zero words. And yet every point is gotten across and understood.

Heck, he's been attached to The Division for several years now and still nothing has advanced on that production.\n\nHe just wrapped The Interpreter with Guy Ritchie and he was in Michael Bay's Ambulance a few months back.

movies,vzt73q,1657903394,Paranormal Activity: Next Of Kin,"I just watched the latest paranormal Activity and ngl by the end I was a little disappointed. Not because I didn’t like the movie, but in my head I was thinking, the last one we saw was finally getting us closer to an answer to all this with the ghost dimension and all that. And I was a little, once again disappointed, that this basically created a whole different story that wasn’t building off the last movie. \n\nSo, I thought about it, and it took me a few seconds after watching it. I ended up thinking, what if Asmodeus was the guy behind it all? Now that sorta got shut down because the ghost of all the movies name was Tobi. But I still stuck with it cuz I kinda liked the idea of that were the case.\n\nI ended up doing some research(cuz the movie has been out for a year) and to my surprise, apparently I might have been right. I saw multiple articles relating Asmodeus to Tobi, something about the Book of Tobit or something and how subtitles might have just spelled the name wrong and the “t” at the end of Tobit was silent which made it sound like Tobi. \n\nThis gives me a whole new perspective on the movie because, knowing that Asmodeus is the guy behind it, means we’ve almost essentially solved this puzzle of paranormal activity. Asmodeus was released into the world and is causing all this chaos from the other movies(prob for laughs) searching for Margot. \n\nIdk what they’re gonna do next or even if they’ll have a next one but we could be seeing a finally quite literally relating back to Margot and Asmodeus. Maybe the first time where we have a good ending and all this is over, or it’s a bad ending and it’s just him getting Margot now the world is fked.

If you really want to make a strong first impression, here's a checklist for you!  Sorry, this is United States specific, but I'm sure with a few tweaks, could easily be adapted to other places.\n\n1) Prepare an **IRS form W-4** ([Link](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf)).  That link is to a fillable pdf you can print.  I recommend typing your information in ALL CAPS for readability.\n\n* Item (c): indicate your marital status\n* Item (2): check that box if you have multiple jobs\n* Item (3): do the math.  \n* Item (4): Consult with a tax pro if you're putting anything in those fields.\n* Let the employer complete the bottom of the form.\n\n2) Prepare a **US Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-9** ([Link](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-9-paper-version.pdf)).  The link is to a fillable pdf.  I recommend typing your information in ALL CAPS for readability.\n\n* Complete Section 1 - wait to sign *with* your new employer\n* Section 2 on page 2: RE-TYPE your name.  Fill out the parts of this form you will be providing to your new employer.  Be thorough.  Either ONE from Column A, or Something in Columns B **AND** C.  Page 3 has descriptions of the pertinent documents.  DO NOT try to fill out the employer Certification Section (bottom of page 2).\n* NOTE: You may still be asked to complete a different I-9 form that your employer has already prepared because they'll have re-filled out their parts on a blank form for you.  But now (conveniently) you'll have all your information readily transferable.\n\n3) Make clear **photocopies** of: (the employer may not ask for all of these, but simply have them handy if they do).  **BRING THE ORIGINALS WITH YOU!**\n\n* Your Drivers License (front and back on one page if you're able)\n* Your Social Security Card\n* Your Birth Certificate\n* Your Military ID or DD-214 (if you're ex-military)\n* Your Work Permit (if required from your school because you're a minor)\n* A voided blank check from your checking account for Direct Deposit (ABA Routing Number and Account Number).\n\n4) Some other **HANDY information** either on paper or on your phone.\n\n* Nearest relative home address, phone number and date of birth\n* Name, address and phone number of your physician and dentist if you may be asked to fill out health insurance enrollment forms.\n* When appropriate, have considered your 401(k) options: ROTH or Traditional?  Deferral percentage?\n\nWhile your new employer may not need ALL of this information, having with you will be enormously helpful if they do!  It will also demonstrate initiative.\n\nGood LUCK!",https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/vzvuai/lpt_okay_youve_accepted_a_new_job_now_do_this/

I can go outside for around 5 minutes and my ear congestion goes away but when I go back into the house it comes back within minutes.

So I did, and she got really mad at first, would call me 3-4 times every time I hang up just to yell at me for hanging up. \n\nBut after a few years, she got used to it.  We still talk on a daily basis, but whenever she tries to step on my boundaries and try to do ""I told you"" or ""do as I said"" talk I simply tell her ""If you are going to continue this attitude I'll hang up"" and I do, and she calls me later as usual without the annoying talk.\n\nAnd I started to implement this on my professional life. And oh boy, it did me wonders. So, I am a computer engineer working for one of the biggest companies in Turkey. I usually get job offers from other companies and I usually accept to do an interview. If the interviewer asks me ""Googling"" questions (the questions where you can find the answer with a simple Google search like ""can you tell us the steps of waterfall project management"") instead of talent questions, I simply tell them that ""You can Google this, do you have any important questions to understand my talents or my thought process?"" if they keep asking similar questions, I just say ""This is not working, have a nice day"" and hang up.\n\nAnd recently I had a similar situation while applying for master's. Applied to two of the top universities in Turkey, both wanted to have interviews. While one of them was focused on my CV, my projects &amp; papers (I published two papers on international journals while I was studying in college) and what I was aiming to do in my master's thesis, the other was different. Had a group interview with 10-12 professors, and the interview was pretty boring. They started with pretty basic maths questions, but I started to get annoyed. One of them asked me ""Can you tell me the name of the shape formed by (insert equation here) in 3D space"", I told them how it would look and said ""I can share my screen and draw it if it was not clear enough"", they said ""Not needed, we are asking only for the name"" and this triggered me but I didn't just quit yet. And then they asked me ""Can you tell us a few root finding algorithms?"" and I said ""Oh there is an algorithm developed by Newton himself (insert algorithm steps here)"" and they replied ""OK we only need the names of the algorithms"" and I just said ""OK, I am not going to continue this, questions are not targeted to measure my academic strengths but my memory of names, I do not want to study in a place where memorising instead of learning is important, have a great day"" and quit the Zoom meeting without waiting for their response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf people are annoying you, tell them that they are annoying you and you will quit the conversation if they continue.

I work at a group home with mentally disabled adults. I work second shift so I'm a little more involved that a full night shifter, but the second half of my shift is really easy.

These places are also desperate to hire, and are usually EXTREMELY flexible, because everyone there always wants overtime - and there's always other homes that have overtime. I wouldn't recommend working day shift while being a college student, because that's a lot of work and can be exhausting, but if you don't mind staying up late and occasionally cleaning gross stuff, and dealing with people who might be behaviorally difficult, then doing schoolwork on night shift is a great way to get paid for doing very little work.

A great focus on the keeping shots interesting, cinematography is outstanding and the choice of locations and settings are all just brilliantly selected.\n\nDe Niro is unrecognisable, a testament to great direction and a sublime actor, Pam Grier steals every scene she is in and Samuel L Jackson's character and actor is just gripping.\n\n I put this movie on years since originally watching it and was immersed the entire time without my mind drifting from the movie from an instant.\n\n Tarantino's true talent is creating fantastical worlds out of the mundane, and telling that story in the most immersive way possible.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Jackie Brown and the way the movie progresses?

movies,vzzzcb,1657921373,The cast and the way they are used in The Talented Mr Ripley is Incredible,"The main 5 of this movie are Matt Damon-Jude Law-Gwyneth Paltrow-Cate Blanchett- and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All deliver great performances in interesting points of their career.\n\nThis is closely after Damon's breakout with Good Will Hunting where he is establishing himself as one of Hollywood's biggest young stars. The depth he is able to add to the character is amazing, he has to deliver a lot of emotionally charged monologues which he totally delivers on. There is a lot of panic growing with in the character throughout the movie that you can feel through the performance.\n\nI think the impact on Jude Law is the most interesting, he had already gained steam through movies like Gattaca but this was really a big test for his potential bankability, if this movie flopped it would have left him in a rough spot.\n\nIt did not though, he delivers one of the most charming performances I have ever seen, you totally relate with Tom Ripley. The scene where he confesses that the drowned girl was pregnant and when he asks Ripley if he actually went to Princeton have such an amazing Ominous tone. Then once you get to the boat scene it's like everything that has been built pays off.\n\nThis is Gwyneth Paltrow right around her prime and while I prefer her performances in Se7en and Tenebaums I do think she did great in this. My favorites scenes of her are probably right around the end where she just seems completely broken. When she finds Dickie's rings and Ripley confronts her, watching her totally break down in fear was an exceptional performance. In her final scene when she knows Ripley killed Dickie but she can't do anything about there is deep tragedy which Paltrow displays on a high level.\n\nI do not have as much to say about Blanchett who plays Merideth but I do believe she elevated the character a lot with her natural charm when I believe Meridith could have easily been a bit of a bland character without the proper actress like Blanchett.\n\nPhillip Seymour Hoffman's Frankie character is absolutely phenomenal, he only has a few scenes but he steals every one. The dynamic he has with Ripley is amazing because Frankie is the one character that truly makes Ripley uneasy. My favorite scene is his final where he is figuring out what Ripley is doing. He helps create the ominous tone and makes the scene incredibly tense.\n\nThe part I really enjoyed about this movie is after Dickies death it does kind of feel like an ensemble movie with a rotating cast of characters, it seems like no matter how big or small the role the character is cast perfectly.\n\nOne of my favorites was Italian actor Sergio Rubini who plays a detective, he really gave off the energy of what I imagine an older Adrien Brody playing the character would give off. Jake Davenport comes in as Peter Smith and I loved him in the interrogation scene speaking Italian. The delivery of his final monolgue was also incredibly haunting.\n\nThe late great Phillip Baker Hall also plays a detective toward the end of the movie and brings his usual charm to make a fun character.\n\nThis movie was incredible and it just gave me a strong urge to write about due to how masterfully it's crafted. I hoped you enjoyed reading this since it's the first time I have really gone in depth on a film like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzzcb/the_cast_and_the_way_they_are_used_in_the/

movies,vzzawc,1657919487,Medieval epics! What is your favorite Medieval movie? Here are a few thoughts of my own.,"I absolutely love medieval epics. There are few things better than watching a long medieval war movie on a rainy day. Luckily, there has been some really good medieval movies in the last few years like ""The King"", ""Outlaw King"" and ""The last Duel"". I've now gone back and watched some older classics that I missed like ""Braveheart"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I'd love some recommendations! \n\nHere are my thought on the movies I've watched and what I plan on watching soon. Spoilers will be contained within the corresponding movie but there will barely be any.\n\nMy favorite historical/war movies during the medieval era have probably been the more recent ones. One reason is likely because the of the tone. \n\n* The King (2019) - The atmosphere of this movie is breathtaking. The slow cinematic shots throughout the movie, accompanied by an amazing soundtrack really sells it. It also has a very lonely, dark and eerie feel that I very much enjoy. I also really like the raw, dirty yet realistic fight scenes throughout the movie. \n* Outlaw King (2018) - I feel like this movie went a bit under the radar, which is a shame because I love this movie. It is somewhat similar to ""The King"" in it's overall atmosphere, that being the rawness and the gorgeous cinematics. I also want to mention how the these two movies managed to portray weather as an integral part, both through plot and visuals. Whenever I picture these movies in my head I feel a sudden urge to grab a blanket and a cup of tea to protect myself from the cold winds that haunt the movies. Also, Chris Pine was phenomenal in this movie.\n* The Last Duel (2021) - I knew I would enjoy this movies as soon as I saw the trailers. It had a great cast and it the visuals looked great which is pretty much expected by Ridley Scott. The story was good, and it felt very realistic and genuine. The fight were fucking amazing and it left me almost shouting in suspense. Finally, Matt Damon fucking slapped in this movie. It might honestly be his best performance, which says a lot. \n\nI also really enjoyed the classics:\n\n* Kingdom of Heaven (2005) - It was really great. It really feels like a classic epic with everything I want from a movie like this. King Baldwin IV (the Leper) was great and his dialogues were a clear highlight.\n* Braveheart (1995) - Although there were some boring parts it was overall extremely entertaining. I was also aware of all the historical inaccuracies before jumping in, so that didn't really bother me. Also The whole ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM"" actually got to me. As ridiculous as it may seem, I actually got a very genuine appreciation of the movie. \n\nHere are some of the movies I plan on watching next:\n\n* Ironclad\n* Ironclad: Battle for Blood\n* Black Death\n* The Green Knight\n* A Knight's Tale\n\nFinally I quickly wanted to note something. I have a strong hatred for sudden psychedelic/supernatural elements in movies in general.  I was really disappointed by ""Valhalla Rising"" because of this reason. If it includes these elements I'm almost immediately turned of. This is also somewhat visible when you look at my favorite medieval movies. The only exception to supernatural elements is if it is deeply ingrained into the universe/setting and is logically explained within it. Examples being Lord of the Rings, which is my favorite movie franchise of all time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzzawc/medieval_epics_what_is_your_favorite_medieval/

movies,vzw4kp,1657910969,The Hollywood fame machine is going absolutely turbo in its effort to catapult Ana de Armas to total A-List superstardom,"During the Johnny Depp  trial, I liked reading to comments under the videos on the Law&amp;Crime  Network YouTube channel, and I noticed an unusually high number of them, through the  weeks, calling for someone named Ana de Armas to replace Amber Heard in  ""Aquaman 2,"" and I saw a few even saying it should be her or Scarlett  Johansson, the top movie actress of the past decade. Then in the past few weeks, on my  Instagram Discover page, where I get a whole bunch of pop-culture posts,  based on what I like to look at, I started seeing so many posts  featuting her, and continue to see them, even though I had only ever  tapped on a couple of them. I then saw articles not just reporting but hyping up that she'll be  playing Marilyn Monroe, the most famous actress of all time, in a Netflix movie later this year. Then I saw on page 3 of yesterday's New  York Post a huge picture of her, and how she'll be on the cover of Elle  magazine next month. Then I just saw her trending on Twitter for some  red carpet event she was at. Hollywood is pushing her like crazy; I  guess she's gonna be touted as the biggest actress in the world by the  end of this year. Based on the past 90 days of traffic to her Wikipedia  aritcle, which is the best index of how many people Googling a name or  term, the publicity is working; it's interesting to see how quickly and overtly this type of promotion is done. Will she be another flash-in-the-pan blonde actress, like Gretchen Mol or Elisha Cuthbert, who were featured on magazine coverse and all over entertainment news but then quickly receded from that level?\n\n[https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-90&amp;pages=Ana\_de\_Armas](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-90&amp;pages=Ana_de_Armas)",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzw4kp/the_hollywood_fame_machine_is_going_absolutely/

Never mind the tone deaf jokes about Thor's losses. The shots combined with voiceover do extremely well. They show Thor as this love-craving guy, who could never find the right woman, however hard he tried. The second montage underline the meaning Jane Foster carried for Thor and how great a pair they were. It was honestly so good it helped me get invested in their relationship. Just incredibly cute and charming. But the Thor-Jane relationship was done remarkably well, so I got no complaints overall. Bravo Waititi.\n\nThe Green Knight's single montage at the end is EVEN BETTER. In just a few seconds, using NOTHING but PURE VISUALS David Lowery establishes the significance of Gawain giving up the green belt - by showing what CAN happen if he doesn't. It's amazing, pure poetry, kino at its finest. Zero words. And yet every point is gotten across and understood. And the best part - our protagonist is clearly SEEING that as well.\n\nMontages can be amazing!\n\nHow about you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzvz4q/montages_what_do_you_think_about_them/

movies,vzt73q,1657903394,Paranormal Activity: Next Of Kin,"I just watched the latest paranormal Activity and ngl by the end I was a little disappointed. Not because I didn’t like the movie, but in my head I was thinking, the last one we saw was finally getting us closer to an answer to all this with the ghost dimension and all that. And I was a little, once again disappointed, that this basically created a whole different story that wasn’t building off the last movie. \n\nSo, I thought about it, and it took me a few seconds after watching it. I ended up thinking, what if Asmodeus was the guy behind it all? Now that sorta got shut down because the ghost of all the movies name was Tobi. But I still stuck with it cuz I kinda liked the idea of that were the case.\n\nI ended up doing some research(cuz the movie has been out for a year) and to my surprise, apparently I might have been right. I saw multiple articles relating Asmodeus to Tobi, something about the Book of Tobit or something and how subtitles might have just spelled the name wrong and the “t” at the end of Tobit was silent which made it sound like Tobi. \n\nThis gives me a whole new perspective on the movie because, knowing that Asmodeus is the guy behind it, means we’ve almost essentially solved this puzzle of paranormal activity. Asmodeus was released into the world and is causing all this chaos from the other movies(prob for laughs) searching for Margot. \n\nIdk what they’re gonna do next or even if they’ll have a next one but we could be seeing a finally quite literally relating back to Margot and Asmodeus. Maybe the first time where we have a good ending and all this is over, or it’s a bad ending and it’s just him getting Margot now the world is fked. I honestly can’t wait to find out this has been my favorite found footage series to date.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vzt73q/paranormal_activity_next_of_kin/
